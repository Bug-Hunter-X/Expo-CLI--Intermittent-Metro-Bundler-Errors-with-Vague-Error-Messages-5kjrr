While building an Expo app, I encountered an error related to the metro bundler that was difficult to debug. The error message was vague, and standard troubleshooting steps (cleaning the cache, reinstalling dependencies, etc.) didn't resolve the issue.  The error appeared intermittently, making it even harder to pinpoint the cause. The build process would seemingly hang, and then eventually terminate with a cryptic error message about a module not being found, even though the module was clearly installed and imported correctly.
