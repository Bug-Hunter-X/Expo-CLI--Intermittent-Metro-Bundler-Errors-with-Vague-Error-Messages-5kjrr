# Expo CLI: Intermittent Metro Bundler Errors

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered while building an Expo app using the Expo CLI. The issue involves intermittent errors from the Metro bundler, resulting in vague error messages that are difficult to debug. Standard troubleshooting techniques often fail to resolve the problem.

## Bug Description

The bug manifests as an intermittent failure during the build process. The build process may hang indefinitely or terminate prematurely with an unclear error message, such as a module not found error, even when the module is correctly installed and imported. The inconsistency of the error makes debugging particularly challenging.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Attempt to build the app (e.g., using `expo build:android`).
5. Observe the intermittent build failures and cryptic error messages.

## Solution

The provided `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a potential solution, which may involve a combination of strategies to improve the reliability of the Metro bundler and provide more informative error messages.  This could include updating dependencies, explicitly specifying module resolutions, or using additional debugging tools to identify the root cause of the failure.
